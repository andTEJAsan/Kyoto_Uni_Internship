\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:discussion}
We presented {\approxMC}, the first $(\varepsilon, \delta)$
approximate counter for CNF formulae that scales in practice to tens
of thousands of variables.  We showed that {\approxMC} reports bounds
with small tolerance in theory, and with much smaller error in
practice, with high confidence. Extending the ideas in this paper to
probabilistic inference and to count models of SMT constraints is an interesting direction of future research.
